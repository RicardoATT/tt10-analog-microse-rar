## How it works

There are 2 different implementations of spiking neurons and a biological synapse circuit, all sharing the same inputs, but with independent outputs. The operation of each circuit is described below:

# Richmond's Synapse:

# Ricardo's Neuron:

# Abraham's Neuron:

## How to test

Each circuit has its own way of being tested, so below is a description of each one:

# Richmond's Synapse:

# Ricardo's Neuron:

# Abraham's Neuron:

## External hardware

All circuits require the use of the following hardware:
- Oscilloscope.
- Power supply.
- Function generator.
